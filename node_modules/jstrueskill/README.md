# JsTrueSkill #

A JavaScript implementation of the TrueSkill ranking algorithm.

Ported from the [Java implementation](https://github.com/davidbilge/JSkills).

Which in turn is ported from the [C# implementation](https://github.com/moserware/Skills).

There are a number of improvements planned:

- refactor various classes to improve the API
- refactor various classes to make them more JavaScript-y
- improve comments
- add example usage
- improve unit tests

Done:

- remove the package structure as it makes little sense in JavaScript
